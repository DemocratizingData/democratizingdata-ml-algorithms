    "# A Baseline for Models That Leverage The Schwartz-Hearst Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Kaggle competition, the Schwartz Hearst Algorithm [(Schwartz & Hearst, 2003)](https://psb.stanford.edu/psb-online/proceedings/psb03/schwartz.pdf) for detecting abbreviations was used by Kaggle Models 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model 2 uses this approach to extract all possible dataset candidates. These are\n",
    "then classified by a binary classifier and the algorithm's other heuristics. So,\n",
    "for at least Kaggle Model 2 this can be used as a baseline for Precision/Recall.\n",
    "This notebook uses specifically model 2's implementation of the algorithm, which\n",
    "is based on the [AllenAI scispacy\n",
    "implementation](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/cc1a71701f1b83bf81d36c47c271ad5ee1c03d45/scispacy/abbreviation.py),\n",
    "but could have introduced some bugs. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Kaggle Model 1 this is less directly informative because they used the\n",
    "actual AllenAI scispacy code (which may or may not produce different results)\n",
    "and they additionally used a custom algorithm to extract more candidate\n",
    "datasets. Further they used the extracted entities to build up a repository of\n",
    "text snippets to be used for training their model. Their method should be\n",
    "evaluated in another notebook to establish better baselines."
